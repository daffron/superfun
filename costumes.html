        <h2>Party Services</h2>
        
        <p>
          Each party is customised for your preferences and I always bring a great selection of equipment to keep the party going non stop! 
          <br/>
          I have lots of options for costumes and themes for kids parties such as pirate, Peter Pan, fireman etc but it's also very easy to buy new costumes if you have a theme that I don't have a costume for! 
          <br/>
          My games and activities are always evolving and I can bring a large range of equipment such as giant bubbles, indoor giant bubbles where I create a big bubble around each child, tug of war, balloon battles, stencil face painting, races, bullrush style games, spinning plates, juggling etc. 
          <br/>
          Another really fun range of costumes that I have are "inflatable" costumes. I've currently got a clown, Bumblebee, cow, captain America, shark eating a diver and a T-Rex!
          <br />
          I do regular toddler events where I do activities from music and dancing, bubbles, story time, jingle bells and musical shakers, balloon games, giant parachute etc. 
          <br/>
          I also do regular holiday programs where I do a large mixture of activities such as bubble art, bookmark making, slime making, cupcake decorating, sprout gardens, pipe cleaner creations and many more to come!

        <h2>More on Superheroes</h2>

          <p>
            Superhero parties are a personal favourite of mine and I love giving kids a real superhero experience with a mixture of top quality costumes, challenges, jokes, games, acrobats showcase, superhero power detecting, balloon battles, stencil face painting and more! 
            <br/>
            I am continually working on more superhero costumes and activities so please enquire as to which superheroes you would like!
            <br/>
            Spiderman, batman, superman, the flash, captain america, ironman, the hulk, spidergirl, catwoman, supergirl, wonder woman, darth vader, jedi, optimus prime transformer, bumblebee transformer, ninja, star wars, dc, marvel.

        <h2>More on Balloon Twisting</h2>
        <p>
          Always a hit at parties, balloon animals are a guaranteed way to break the ice and get kids involved! 
          <br/>
          I've created custom made balloon boxes that are portable and allow quick and effective balloon work!
          <br/>
          I usually bring a special themed balloon present for the birthday child!

        <h2>More on Facepainting</h2>
        <p>
          I've created a large range of awesome stencil designs that go on the children's cheek/forehead/arms/hands. 
          These are really effective and great for quickly giving large numbers of kids face painting at an event. <br>
          With many designs and themes to choose from, there will be something for everyone:<br/>
          Superheroes, butterflies, flowers, fairies, princess, frozen, cute animals, Star Wars, aliens, Halloween, Christmas, Transformers, ninja turtles, minions, Pokemon, dragons, dinosaurs, tigers, sharks,  robots, Thomas the tank engine, planes, skulls, snakes, stars, ice cream, spongebob, unicorns, horses and more~

        <h2>More on Piggy Back Costumes</h2>
        <p>
          My Piggy Back Costumes are hilarious fun at parties for children and adults! 
          <br/>
          Ive done many Piggy Back Costume balloon twisting events but I'm now focusing on Piggy Back "shows" as the costumes are just perfect for shorter timed immersive shows that I usually combine with other activities for the second half of the party out of the costume such as balloon twisting/giant bubbles. 
          <br/>
          All the Piggy Back Costumes are one of a kind-custom created by myself to be the highest quality and I am continually working on more! 
          <br/>
          I currently have the following characters: bunny, gorilla, dog, koala, elephant and a double stacked mini elephant and bunny! 
          <br/>
          Please enquire to see which characters are available!
